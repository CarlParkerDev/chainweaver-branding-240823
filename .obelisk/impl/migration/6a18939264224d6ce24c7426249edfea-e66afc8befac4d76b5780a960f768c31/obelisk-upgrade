# ob deploy: HTTPs support

Obelisk deployments now support HTTPs. You must upgrade the deployment repo
associated with the obelisk project as follows:

```
cd /your/project's/deployment/repo
echo True > enable_https
echo admin@yoursite.com > admin_email
echo https://yoursite.com/ > config/common/route
git add ... && git commit ...
ob deploy push
```

If you do not wish to enable HTTPs, write `False` to `enable_https` instead.
