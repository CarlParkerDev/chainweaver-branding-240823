/*
  A checkbox-container is some element that contains a single checkbox
  somewhere and should behave like all of it were the checkbox. E.g. hover on
  the container changes the checkbox style, the cursor will be a pointer
  everywhere in the container and a click should toggle the checkbox (this
  needs to be taken care of in code.)
